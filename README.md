# Python Code for Master's Thesis - Predictive Modeling of Asset Returns

- `Data.ipynb`: This file prepares the dataset for asset return prediction. It loads the dataset, visualizes it, extracts subsets for simpler experimentation, identifies and normalizes relevant features, filters the datasets, and saves them.
- `Fine-Tuning_SBERT_colab.ipynb`: This file trains a fine-tuned SBERT model for asset return prediction using Google Colab. It first loads and preprocesses the data. Then, it fine-tunes the SBERT model using a custom architecture and training/evaluation routine. Lastly, it saves the trained model, generates embeddings, and averages them over the dates.
- `AssetReturnPrediction.ipynb`: This file generates 1-Day and 5-Day ahead predictions for EURO STOXX 50 using ARIMA and LSTM models. It begins by defining functions and importing the data. Next, the data is preprocessed to meet the needs of the models before generating predictions. Lastly, the results are visualized and compared.
