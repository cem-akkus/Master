# Python Code for Master's Thesis - Predictive Modeling of Asset Returns

- `Data.ipynb`: This file prepares Dataset for Asset Return Prediction. It loads the dataset, extracts subsets for simpler experimentation, identifies relevant features, filters the datasets and saves them.
- `DataVisualisations.ipynb`: This file assists in getting a feel for the data by creating visualisations, some of which will be included in the paper. Additionally, the notebook conducts tests to ensure the data is suitable for ARIMA modeling.
- `AssetReturnPrediction.ipynb`: This file makes 1-Day and 5-Day ahead predictions for EURO STOXX 50 using ARIMA and LSTM models. The different models and their parameters are created before final results are obtained.
